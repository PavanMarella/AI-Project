# AI-Project
project on detecting fraud accounts on twitter using Machine Learning Algorithms                                                                                       
. Used ml algo to group real and fake users on twitter
. The ml algo which are implemented is
Naive bayes
KNN
SVC
these algorithms will calculate the error rate and accuracy of the datasets and predict the fraud account users
. for accuracy we used confusion matrix, 
. visualization comparision
. output
. required libraries- pandas, pip install 
. code(python)
. dataset from kaggle
. also a manual entry can do it
. CSV file
. change file name
. dataset name
